# Fixed Assets DB

## Description

This is the model file of a relational database, made in MySQL Workbench, intended to store the information of the **Fixed Assets** of a company, with special focus on **IT Resources**.

This is an ongoing work, which I'm not sure whether it's being done out of boredom or with the purpose of serving as the base of a Managerial CRUD project I might start; and not having anywhere better to store it, I'd decided to keep it in GitHub for now.

Currently I'm reviewing a couple of business rules which may break a major havoc amongst my poor table structure.

Besides this README file, 3 other files are included:

- The MWB file is the model itself, for use with the MySQL Workbench app.
- An exported SQL file, for execution in the RDBMS.
- An exported PDF file, with the EER Diagram.
